# G-Shifter-T3PA-Loadcell
Arduino based interface for Logitech G shifter and Thrustmaster T3PA with load cell mod with HX711

Simple sketch for an Arduino Pro Micro interface.
- Logitech G shifter
- "H" pattern or sequential mode selectable on the fly via "press and up/down" gear lever
- Thrustmaster T3PA pedals with normal pot or loadcell brake via HX711 (80Hz)

STILL TO DO:
- potentiometer/loadcell selection via hardware switch
- schematics
